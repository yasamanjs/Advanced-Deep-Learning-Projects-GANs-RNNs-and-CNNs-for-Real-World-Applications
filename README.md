  Regenerated the CIFAR-10 dataset by building and training GANs, demonstrating proficiency in generative modeling and data augmentation.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**:  
  Devised RNNs for **stock market analysis**, achieving high predictive accuracy with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of **8%**.

- **LSTM Networks**:  
  Leveraged **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to forecast air quality indices with an **R² score of 0.91**, enabling actionable environmental insights.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:  
  Built CNN architectures for **CIFAR-10 image classification**, achieving **85% accuracy** through advanced hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.

### 2. IMDb Sentiment Analysis Using Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Fine-tuned a pre-trained transformer-based **LLM (distilbert-base-uncased)** using Hugging Face Transformers to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.
- Achieved **high accuracy and robust performance metrics** (accuracy, F1-score) by fine-tuning the LLM on a custom subset of **10,000 IMDb reviews**.
- Designed a **GPU-accelerated training pipeline** for efficient computations and developed an end-to-end workflow including **data preprocessing**, **model optimization**, and **real-time sentiment prediction**.
